# My Bookstore Web App

## Description

Building this web application was a rewarding experience, albeit with some challenges. In the process of creating My Bookstore Web App, I faced difficulties that required problem-solving and learning. However, overcoming these challenges was a valuable part of the development journey.

My Bookstore Web App is a simple web application built with AngularJS, HTML, CSS, and the Google Books API. This app allows users to search for books, view book details, and add books to their favorites.

## Features

- Search for books by title, author, or keyword.
- View detailed information about each book.
- Add books to your favorites(unfortunatly this process with bug).

3. Start the Express server to serve static files (assuming you have Express.js installed):
